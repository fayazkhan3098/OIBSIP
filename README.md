<h1>console-based ATM interface</h1>
This GitHub repository contains the code for a console-based ATM interface developed during my Java development internship at Oasis Infobyte Pvt. Ltd. 
The project includes functionality for viewing balance, withdrawing, depositing, and viewing mini statements. 
It showcases my Java programming skills, particularly in object-oriented programming, data structures, and logic implementation. 
This project was a key learning experience for me, as it was my first practical application of Java programming concepts learned in a theoretical setting.
# Number Guessing Game

<h1>console-based number guessing game</h1>
This project is a console-based number guessing game developed during my Java development internship at Oasis Infobyte Pvt. Ltd. The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it within 10 attempts.

## Features

- Utilizes Java programming concepts such as classes, objects, loops, and conditional statements.
- Provides feedback to the player on each guess, indicating whether the guess is higher or lower than the actual number.
- Displays the number of attempts remaining and the final score upon successful guessing.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files using `javac GuessNumber.java`.
3. Run the game using `java GuessNumber` and follow the on-screen instructions.

Feel free to contribute to the project by forking the repository and submitting a pull request with your changes.
