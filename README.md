<h1>console-based ATM interface</h1>
This GitHub repository contains the code for a console-based ATM interface developed during my Java development internship at Oasis Infobyte Pvt. Ltd. 
The project includes functionality for viewing balance, withdrawing, depositing, and viewing mini statements. 
It showcases my Java programming skills, particularly in object-oriented programming, data structures, and logic implementation. 
This project was a key learning experience for me, as it was my first practical application of Java programming concepts learned in a theoretical setting.
